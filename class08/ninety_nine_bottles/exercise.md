# Ninety-Nine Bottles, more...

1. Add pluralization logic to your views that makes the app correctly format "99 bottles" versus "1 bottle".

2. Add logic that swaps the "Keep Singing" button for a "Start Over" button upon the final refrain.

3. Add a new view for the `get "/"` (root) path. Make this a title page for the app with a "Start" button on it.

4. Adjust your controller methods so that accessing a bottle count outside the range 0-99 redirects the user to the title page.
