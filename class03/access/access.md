# Array and Hash Practice

In YOUR folder for class02, create a file called `access.txt`. As you work through this assignment, write down the answers in that `access.txt` file.

###Array and Hash access

**A. Copy and paste the following data structure into pry:**

`instructors_array = ["Peter", "Greg", "Martin"]`

1. Use pry to access the string `"Peter"`
2. Use pry to add your name to the end of the array?
3. Use pry to remove `"Greg"` from the array.
4. Use pry to access the last item in the array. 

**B. Copy and paste the following data structure into pry:**

`vladimir_putins_brain = { :launch_code => "a5Mjp257GHMGH23e5qxE", :fav_hobby => "Riding ponies", "prideful?" => true }`

1. Use pry to return the string `"Riding ponies"`
2. Use pry to return the string `"a5Mjp257GHMGH23e5qxE"`
3. Use pry to add the key-value pair `"number_of_wishes" => "three"` to `vladimir_putins_brain`
4. Use pry to add the key-value pair `4 => "four"`
5. Use pry to remove the key-value pair `"prideful?" => true`

**C. Given the following data structure:**

`boolean_hash = { true => "It's true!", false => "It's false" }`

1. What is the return value of `boolean_hash[2 + 2 == 4]`?
2. What is the return value of `boolean_hash["Peter" == "Martin"]`?
3. What is the return value of `boolean_hash[9 > 10]`?
4. What is the return value of `boolean_hash[0]`?
5. What is the return value of `boolean_hash["Greg"]`?
6. What is the return value of `boolean_hash[false||true]`?
6. What is the return value of `boolean_hash[false||"Martin"]`?

### Nested Arrays & Hashes

**Given the following data structure:**

    users = {
      "Peter" => {
        :github => "peterylai",
        :favorite_numbers => [12, 42, 75]
      },
      "Greg" => {
        :github => "gmac",
        :favorite_numbers => [11, 99, 24]
      },
      "Martin" => {
        :github => "mobjohnson",
        :favorite_numbers => [17, 13, 21]
      }
    }

1. How would you access Martin's Github handle (i.e. the string "mobjohnson")?
2. How would you add the number 7 to Greg's favorite numbers?
3. How would you add yourself to the users hash?
4. How would you return the array of Peter's favorite numbers?
5. How would you return the smallest of Martin's favorite numbers?
6. How would you return an array of Greg's favorite numbers that are also even?
