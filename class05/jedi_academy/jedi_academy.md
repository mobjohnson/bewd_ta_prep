# Jedi Academy


## 1. Setup

* Access the Postgres console using the `psql` command.

* Run `CREATE DATABASE jedi_academy;` to create the database.

* Run `\l` to see the list of available databases.

* Run `\c jedi_academy` to connect to the database.

* Run `\d` to see the list of database tables (there are none).

* Open `padawans.sql`, and copy the entire contents. Paste that into the Postgres console, and hit enter. What just happened? Review the SQL file:

  1. We purged any existing "padawans" table (line 1).
  2. We created a new "padawans" table (lines 3-9).
  3. We seeded the table with data (lines 11-34).

* Run `\d` to see the list of database tables now.

* Run `SELECT * FROM padawans;` to see all records.

## 2. SQL Exercise

**Write SQL statements to perform the following tasks:**

1. Select all padawans with a purple lightsaber.

2. Select all padawans that have completed exactly 7 training missions.

3. Select all padawans that have completed more than 5 training missions, AND have a blue lightsaber.

4. Select all padawans with a red lightsaber, ordered by name.

5. Select yourself by your primary key (id).

6. Update your lightsaber color to be your favorite color.

7. Update your apprenticeship status to being complete.

### Bonus

1. Insert Peter, Greg, and Martin into the academy.

2. Delete someone with a red lightsaber from the school.

## 3. ActiveRecord Exercise

Write ActiveRecord queries to perform the following tasks:

1. Select all padawans.

2. Select all padawans with a purple lightsaber, ordered by name.

3. Update all padawans with a purple lightsaber to have a pink lightsaber instead.

4. Find your record by its id. Store it in a variable.

5. Adjust your Jedi name to include your last name, then save this change to the database.

6. Define a `randomize_lightsaber` method on the Padawan class. It should assign a random color to a padawan's lightsaber, then save the record.
