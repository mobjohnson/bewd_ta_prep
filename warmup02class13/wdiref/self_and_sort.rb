# Access the depth of John Hammond's mine in Mexico.

# Access the annual budget for Hammond's mine in Buenos Airies.

# Access the stegosaurous.

# Access the dinosaur DNA specimens found in Nicaragua.

# Access the "Parasaurolophus" specimen.

# Your budget has been cut. Return an array, low_budget_mines, of only the mines with a budget at or below 100_000_000
# Your budget has been re-upped and you've decided you're going to open a park using the DNA specimens found in Nicaragua (they're the most popular). But there's a big problem; It's a liability to create dinosaurs that can breed in the wild, so you have to add a dash of asexual frog dna to ensure they can't breed, BUT YOU CAN'T RUIN THE ORIGINAL SPECIMENS. Thankfully, you have an ace programmer, Dennis Nedrey, who tells you about a hot new array method called .map, which allows you to create a new array based on another. Create an array of dinosaurs specimens, each "with a dash of asexual frog DNA".
