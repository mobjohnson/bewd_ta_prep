# Let's talk About Final Projects!!!

**Objectives:**

* Encourage

## What should my app be about?

Somthing you care about, or that interests you!


## How do I get a sense of what I can accomplish?

Look at what others have done!!!

[General Assembly - Back End Web Development Projects](http:??http://gallery.ga.co/BEWD?metro=)


## Where do I find APIs?

[Programmable Web API Directory](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) or the [Public APIs Directory](http://www.publicapis.com/).

## How complicated should my app be?

Not very!!!

You can always take something simple and make it more complex. It is difficult to start with something that is complicated, and deliver a Minimum Viable Product.

The goal for this class is to make something that works!!!

## Can I build an app unlike any app that has ever been built before?

Maybe??? But unlikely. It is more important that you demonstrate your skills than that you demonstrate your capacity for innovation.

## Does the appearance of my app matter?

Oh yeah. Your app will be judged my functionality and appearance, so make sure you add some color and cat images!
