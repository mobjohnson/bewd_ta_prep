# Let's talk About Final Projects!!!


**Objectives:**

* Get you thinking about your final project



## Context - how much more new material will we learn in class?

Not much! We will be workinf more with APIs today, going over User Authentication on Monday and covering an Advanced topic on Wednesday. But, we have already covered the Ruby on Rails capability you will use for your project



## What should my app be about?

Somthing you care about, or that interests you!



## How do I get a sense of what I can accomplish?

Look at what others have done!!!

[GA Gallery -> Back End Web Development Projects](http:??http://gallery.ga.co/BEWD?metro=)



## Where do I find APIs?

[Programmable Web API Directory](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) or the [Public APIs Directory](http://www.publicapis.com/).



## How complicated should my app be?

Not very!!!

You can always take something simple and make it more complex. It is difficult to start with something that is complicated, and deliver a Minimum Viable Product.

The goal for this class is to make something that works!!!

You will be submitting your ideas, along with a description of scope of implementation for instructors.



## Can I build an app unlike any app that has ever been built before?

Maybe??? But unlikely. It is more important that you demonstrate your skills than that you demonstrate your capacity for innovation.



## Does the appearance of my app matter?

You should demonstrate what you have learned. Functionality is key. You are going to want to the URL for you app to you friends. Your app will be judged by functionality and appearance, so make sure you add some color and cat images!

Budget your time to allow at least some use of CSS. Your app will be judged by others by both functionality and appearance, so make sure you add some color and cat images!
